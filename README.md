# SDJ2_Assignment_2

## The system:

You mustdesign and implement a simple client/server applicationas a chat system with multiple clients.

## Requirements:
- The application mustuseSocketsconnecting client and server, with the server being multithreaded
- The client must be able to 1) send messages, 2) receive messages broadcasted to all clients and 3) request an information from the 
server not to be broadcasted to other clients, e.g. numberof connected chatters, list of connected chatters or similar.
- You mustuse MVVMwith at least two windows.
- You must use the Observer design pattern as part ofthe solution.
- You must use the Factory method design pattern as part of the solution (e.g. in the View)
- You must use either Singleton or Multiton as a log to the server console and to file(s). 
It should always be possible to find all the communication foran entire day â€“text, ip address, date and time.
- It is required to make a class diagram for the final solution (in Astah). In the diagram you mustbe able to identify the MVVM, the Observer pattern, 
The Factory methodand the design of the socketsrelated classes.

## The result:
